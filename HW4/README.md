#HW4 Spectrogram of Thai Phonemes

The objective of this assignment is for students to get familiar with spectrograms of Thai phonemes as well as exploring on their own about Thai vowels whose specific formant values might not be given directly in the course materials.

Response to each item in a report.

1. Record yourself speaking "all Thai tense vowels" in an utterance (utterance-1). Re-arrange the sequence of the vowels so that the order of the vowels are different from the first recording. Record yourself speaking the new utterance (utterance-2).

2. Use [praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) to plot a "wide-band" spectrogram of each of the utterance. Capture the pictures of both spectrogram. On each of the picture, label the vowels and manually draw the 1st and 2nd formant tracks of the vowels (Try to draw the tracks by yourself. Praat can suggest formant tracks but you should consider the tracks whether you think they are correct or not. The suggestions are not always correct). Put the pictures (with labels and tracks) into your report.

3. Construct a vowel chart based on your recording. The values of F1 and F2 should be averaged (from utterance-1 and utterance-2) from the values in the middle of each vowel. Make sure the axes of your vowel chart contain are labeled with frequency values in Hz (or kHz). Put the value of the vowel chart into your report.

Create a new row with your student ID and your name in the following Google Sheet:

[HW4: Formant Values of Thai Tense Single Vowels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fmzt8dB4K16IRos-V541HIB77VQrtX8C6rop0X7FvSE/edit?usp=sharing)

Fill the average values of F1 and F2 for all vowels that you measured.
